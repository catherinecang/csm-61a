\question Draw the environment diagram for the following code snippet:
\begin{lstlisting}
def one(two):
    three = two
    def four(five):
        nonlocal three
        if len(three) < 1:
            three += [five]
            five = lambda x: four(x)
        else:
            five = seven + 7
        return five
    two = two + [1]
    seven = 8
    return four(three)

eight = one([])
print(eight(9))
\end{lstlisting}
