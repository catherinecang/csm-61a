\question \textbf{Food Planning Scheme}
\begin{parts}
\part You and your 61A friends are cons. You cdr'd just studied for the final,
but instead you scheme to drive away across a stream in a car during dead week.
Of course, you would like a variety of food to eat on your roadtrip.

Write an infinite stream that takes in a list of foods and loops back to the
first food in the list when the list is exhausted.\\
\textbf{Bonus:} Count all the puns in this question!

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
(define (food-stream foods)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1.0in]
    We counted \textbf{6 puns}.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Scheme in the question title.
        \item ``cons'', first sentence.
        \item ``cdr'' vs. could've, second sentence.
        \item ``scheme'' to drive away, second sentence.
        \item ``stream'', second sentence.
        \item ``car'', second sentence.
    \end{enumerate}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
(define (food-stream foods)
  (cons-stream (car foods)
               (food-stream (append (cdr foods)
                                    (list (car foods))))
  )
)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}

\part We discover that some of our food is stale! Every other food that we go
through is stale, so put it into a new stale food stream. Assume
\texttt{is-stale} starts off at 0.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
(define (stale-stream foods is-stale)
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[1.0in]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scheme]
(define (stale-stream foods is-stale)
  (cond ((null? foods) nil)
        ((= is-stale 1)
          (cons-stream (car foods)
                       (stale-stream (cdr foods) 0)))
        (else (stale-stream (cdr foods) 1))
  )
)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
\end{parts}
