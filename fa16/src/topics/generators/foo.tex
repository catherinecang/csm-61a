\question What does the following code block output?
\begin{lstlisting}
def foo():
    a = 0
    if a < 10:
        print("Hello")
        yield a
        print("World")

for i in foo():
    print(i)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[0.75in]
\begin{lstlisting}
Hello
0
World
\end{lstlisting}
First time you call foo, it will yield a (which starts as 0)
\end{solution}

\question How can we modify \texttt{foo} so that
\texttt{list(foo()) == [1, 2, 3, . . . , 10]}?
(It's ok if there are extra \texttt{print}s)

\begin{solution}[0.50in]
Change the \texttt{if} to a \texttt{while} statement, and make sure to increment
a. This looks like:

\begin{lstlisting}
def foo():
    a = 0
    while a < 10:
        a += 1
        yield a
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
