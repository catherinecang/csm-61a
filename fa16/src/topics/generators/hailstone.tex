\question Define \texttt{hailstone\char`_sequence} a generator that yields the
hailstone sequence. Remember, for the hailstone sequence, if n is even, we need
to divide by two, otherwise, we will multiply by 3 and add by 1.

\begin{lstlisting}
; Doctests:
>>> hs_gen = hailstone_sequence(10)
>>> hs_gen.__next__()
10
>>> next(hs_gen) #equivalent to previous
5
>>> for i in hs_gen:
>>> print(i)
16
8
4
2
1
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}
def hailstone_sequence(n):
    while n != 1:
        yield n
        if n % 2 == 0:
            n = n // 2
        else:
            n = n*3 + 1
    yield n
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
