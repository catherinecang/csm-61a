\question (Optional) Define \texttt{tree\_sequence}, a generator that iterates
through a tree by first yielding the root value and then yield each branch.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> tree = Tree(1, [Tree(2, [Tree(5)]), Tree(3, [Tree(4)])])
>>> print(list(tree_sequence(tree)))
[1, 2, 5, 3, 4]
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
\begin{lstlisting}
def tree_sequence(tree):
	yield tree.entry
	for branch in tree.branches:
		for value in tree_sequence(branch):
			yield value
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
