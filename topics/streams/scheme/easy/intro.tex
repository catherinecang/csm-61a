\question What are the differences between streams and scheme lists? What's the advantage of using a stream 
over a linked list?
\begin{solution}[1.0in]
Scheme lists have another list as their second element, streams have another stream as the second argument to
their constructor.
Streams also wrap their second element in a promise. This means that in order to calculate the second element,
we have to force that promise. Therefore, streams are lazily evaluated, and we need to use cons-stream in order
to access the second element (instead of just being able to use cons, which do not force a promise).
Streams are good because of lazy evaluation. We only evaluate up to what we need at any given point, allowing
us to change the environment or save space between calculating elements.
\end{solution}

\question What's the maximum size of a stream?
\begin{solution}[1.0in]
Infinity
\end{solution}

\question When is the next element actually calculated?
\begin{solution}[1.0in]
Only when it's requested (and hasn't already been calculated)
\end{solution}
