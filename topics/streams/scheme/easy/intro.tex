\question What's the advantage of using a stream over a linked list?
\begin{solution}[1.0in]
Lazy evaluation. We only evaluate up to what we need.
\end{solution}

\question What's the maximum size of a stream?
\begin{solution}[1.0in]
Infinity
\end{solution}

\question What's stored in first and rest? What are their types?
\begin{solution}[1.0in]
First is a value, rest is another stream (either a method to calculate it, or an already calculated stream). In the case
 of Scheme, this is called a promise.
\end{solution}

\question When is the next element actually calculated?
\begin{solution}[1.0in]
Only when it's requested (and hasn't already been calculated)
\end{solution}
