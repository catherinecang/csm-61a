\question What is the difference between lambda functions and def statements? What is one of the purposes of higher order functions?

\begin{solution}[0.5in]
Lambda functions and def statements are similar in use,  but they are written differently. Lambda functions can be written in one line while def statements take multiple lines. Lambda functions can also only have a single expression. In practice, we use lambda functions and higher-order functions to write short \emph{adapters} programs, or functions that help us connect two programs together.
