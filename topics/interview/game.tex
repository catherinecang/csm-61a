\question Imagine we have a game where there are multiple cards with numbers laid out in a straight line. 
Each turn, a player can take a card from the very left, or the very right. 
\newline
We want to write a function, \texttt{game}, that takes a list representing the cards. It should return True if there is a series of moves such that after all cards have been removed, the scores for both players are equal.
\newline
\begin{lstlisting}
def game(cards):
    """
    >>> game([1, 2, 3]) #1, then 3, then 2
    True
    >>> game([1, 1, 1])
    False
    >>> game([])
    True
    """
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}
    def game_helper(curr, other, cards):
      if not lst:
         return curr == other
      else:
         return game_helper(other, curr + lst[0], lst[1:]) or game_helper(other, curr + lst[-1], lst[:-1])
		return game_helper(0, 0, cards)
\end{lstlisting}
