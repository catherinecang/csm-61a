\question \textbf{Mysterious loops:} What is the order of growth in time for the following functions? Use big-O notation.

\begin{parts}

\part
\begin{lstlisting}
def mystery(n):
    for i in range(n):
        while i % 2 != 0:
            print(i)
            i = i - 1
        print("Done")
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[0.25in]
$O(n)$. The work for when $i$ is divisible by two is constant. Subtracting one
will immediately allow us to exit the \texttt{while} loop. Therefore, we can
concentrate on just the outer loop.
\end{solution}

\part
\begin{lstlisting}
def fun(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n * n):
            if j == 4:
                return -1
            print("Fun!")
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{solution}[0.25in]
$O(1)$. Inner loop always immediately exits after running for 4 iterations,
independent of $n$.
\end{solution}
