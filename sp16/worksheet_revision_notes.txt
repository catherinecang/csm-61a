notes

week 4:
num_digits: 0 now counts as a digit, so num_digits(0) returns 1; base case changed to match
is_sorted: leaving as is, working from the right is much easier to code, retrieving the left digit is more work than we wnat this question to take
leaving mystery as is, we find it to pretty useful.

week 5:
added simple splicing, worried about doing too much since this worksheet is already pretty heavy on concepts and material
leaving all_primes as is
Changed elephant_roster to use a list comprehension
Tree DA: removed some of the comments and asserts that were extraneous or just wrong.

Week 6:
removed negation

Week 7:
HOOP: we talked about it, and we don't think that it needs any changing
teamBaller: removed super, properly returns true or false
having techincal difficulties with spacing for providing more space with the blanks

Week 8:
This worksheet emphasized orders of growth alot because of Hillfinger, since he does alot of orders of growth. Can change if we don't use it as summer
**
will come back to pancake
**
got rid of slow, 3 parts covering the same trick was definitely too redundant
added a comment to assure that square() runs in constant time
for 6:, we used label and children because Hilfinger used them, changed back to root and branches
6(a): got rid of the hint and the "== True"
7: created insert_at_start() as a precursor to insert_at_end, not using mutation for insert_at_start though. Changed the name of insert_many to insert_many_end for clarity
